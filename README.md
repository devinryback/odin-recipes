# odin-recipes

I am working my way through The Odin Project curriculum, arriving now at "Project: Recipes".

## Pre-Project

By completing this project I will demonstrate my comprehension of basic HTML skills and knowledge, including:

- HTML Boilerplate
- <h1>Heading</h1>
- <a>Anchor</a>
- Image <img src="" alt="">
- <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes">Absolute Link</a>
- <a href="./odin-recipes/pages/about.html">Relative Link</a>
- Adherence to formatting best practices, such as indentation and effective use of whitespace
- Adherence to commit best practices
- And perhaps more

I will update this README post-project with a summary and conclusion.

## Post-Project

This was fun. I found myself wanting to include other features or styles beyond my current knowledge. Practicing patience to keep this fire of learning at a slow and steady burn ðŸ”¥

Where I lacked the ability to implement more advanced HTML, I instead had fun with writing the copy. There is a bonus easter egg to be found ðŸ‘€ which might be enjoyable for philosophically, existentially minded folks.

**Note:** If this were a legit recipe website I wanted to make, I would be far more descriptive.
