    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This recipe will help you make <em>taco beef!</em></p>

    <p>You can use this taco-seasoned beef for whatever you like, including, of course, tacos.</p>

    <p><em>Let's begin!</em></p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p>These ingredients make <strong>4 servings</strong>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>1 lb Ground Beef (85% Fat / 15% Lean)</li>
      <li>Sea Salt</li>
      <li>Cumin</li>
      <li>Coriander</li>
      <li>Smoked Paprika</li>
      <li>Garlic Powder</li>
      <li>Onion Powder</li>
      <li>Cayenne Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li><em>Brown the ground!</em> Before you add any seasonings, cook the ground beef until it all turns brown. Use your cooking utensil to continually break it down into smaller pieces to get it all browned properly.</li>
      <li><em>As your beef is browning:</em> In a small bowl mix all of your seasonings together, except for the sea salt. I never measure spices, so... I can't help you with that part.</li>
      <li><em>When your beef is fully browned:</em> Sprinkle your seasoning mix all over it, and stir it all in. Make sure to get those seasonings to touch as much of the meat as possible for consistent flavor.</li>
      <li>Salt to taste.</li>
      <li><strong>That's it! <em>Enjoy!</em></strong></li>
      <li>*** BONUS: Put it in a taco, ya ding-dong.</li>
    </ol>
