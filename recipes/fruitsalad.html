    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is a simple fruit salad recipe for any occasion. I have chosen some fruits which I think combine flavors and textures well together, but you can use any fruits you like.</p>

    <p>The key is using fresh fruits that are just the right ripenessâ€”and the special dressing.</p>

    <p><em>Let's begin!</em></p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p>These ingredients make <strong>4 servings</strong></p>.

    <ul>
      <li>2 Bananas</li>
      <li>1 Cup Blueberries</li>
      <li>3 Kiwis</li>
      <li>1 Navel Orange</li>
      <li>1 Lemon</li>
      <li>1 Tsp Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
      <li>2 Pinches Sea Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Make sure all of your fruits are <em>fresh and ripe!</em> What's ripe for you may be different than what's ripe for me, especially with bananas. I like mine to be yellow, with no brown spots.</li>
      <li>Peel your bananas, orange, and kiwis.</li>
      <li>Cut your bananas into slices, about 1/2 inch thick.</li>
      <li>Cut your kiwis into chunks, about 1 inch x 1 inch.</li>
      <li>Separate the wedges of your orange and slice each wedge into 3 pieces. Remember to <em>remove the seeds!</em></li>
      <li>Place all of this fruit, along with your cup of blueberries, into a large bowl.</li>
      <li>In a separate container, like a liquid measuring cup: squeeze the juice of your lemon, add the ACV and sea salt. <em>Remove any lemon seeds which may have squeezed in!</em> Now mix these together until the salt is dissolved.</li>
      <li>Pour the dressing all over the bowl of fruit, and use a large spoon to mix it in. Be sure to get the dressing <em>all over the fruit!</em></li>
      <li><strong>That's it! <em>Enjoy!</em></strong></li>
      <li>*** BONUS: Serve your fruit salad over a bed of cold Greek yogurt. Yum.</li>
    </ol>
